# question 1

create a type for an object "user" which accept 2 properties:


```js
user = {
    id: "USR-11bf5b37-e0b8-42e0-8dcf-dc8c4aefc000",
    bio: "yadda yadd"
}
```


- `id` accept a string which always start with `USR-` followed by a uuidv4 ( like the one generated by the [uuidv4 npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4) ) 

- `bio` is a string with max length of 280  characters


try to do this in plain typescript. if you like, then you can try doing it with the zod library
